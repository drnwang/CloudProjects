## ✅ Terraform + AWS: Common Issues FAQ

### 🔑 **Q: Terraform says `The key pair 'xyz' does not exist`**

**A:** Terraform does **not** create EC2 key pairs automatically. You need to:

* Go to AWS EC2 Console → Key Pairs → Create a new key
* Download the `.pem` file
* Set the key name in `main.tf`:

  ```hcl
  key_name = "your-key-name"
  ```
* Ensure the `.pem` file exists at the path used in `private_key = file("...")`.

### 🧱 **Q: `InvalidAMIID.NotFound` — AMI ID is wrong?**

**A:** Each AWS region has different AMI IDs. If you're using a hardcoded AMI:

* Confirm your `provider` region (e.g. `us-east-1`)
* Find the right Amazon Linux 2 AMI for that region from the EC2 Console or AWS docs
* Replace in Terraform:

  ```hcl
  ami = "ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  ```

### 🌐 **Q: My EC2 instance launches but I can't SSH into it**

**A:** Possible causes:

* Port 22 is not allowed in your security group
* Key pair doesn't match what’s on the instance
* Wrong username (`ec2-user` for Amazon Linux 2)

Double-check:

* Security group includes:

  ```hcl
  ingress {
    from_port = 22
    to_port   = 22
    protocol  = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  ```
* You're using the correct `.pem` file and region

---

### 🚥 **Q: `remote-exec` fails with “Unit not found” or “command not found”**

**A:** The provisioner ran before required packages were installed, or you're using the wrong base AMI.

Fix:

* For Amazon Linux 2, use `amazon-linux-extras` to install NGINX:

  ```bash
  sudo amazon-linux-extras enable nginx1
  sudo yum install -y nginx
  ```

---

### 📡 **Q: Terraform hangs during `terraform apply`**

**A:** Most common causes:

* The `.pem` file is not found or has wrong permissions
* The EC2 instance is not yet reachable (still initializing)
* You’re using a Windows-style path (backslashes) for SSH keys

Fixes:

* Use absolute paths with `/` instead of `\`:

  ```hcl
  private_key = file("C:/Users/yourname/.ssh/key.pem")
  ```
* Add a `connection { timeout = ... }` block if the instance takes longer to become reachable

### ☁️ **Q: Do I need to destroy instances to update them?**

**A:** Not always. Terraform updates in-place when possible. But if `subnet_id`, `AMI`, or `key_name` changes, it **must destroy and recreate**.

---

### ↺ **Q: How do I output values like public IP?**

Create an `outputs.tf` file:

```hcl
output "instance_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.nginx_server.public_ip
}
```
